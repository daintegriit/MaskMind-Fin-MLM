        ## üìà Understanding Confidence Scores:

        Each prediction comes with a **confidence score**, shown as a percentage.

        - A **higher confidence** (e.g., 80%-90%) means the model is **very certain** about its prediction.<br>
        - A **lower confidence** (e.g., 5%-15%) means the model is **less sure**, but the prediction might still make sense.<br><br>

        Confidence is calculated based on the model‚Äôs probability of choosing that particular masked word among many possibilities.
